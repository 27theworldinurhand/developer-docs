Creating a gateway module allows connection from WHMCS to providers that aren’t supported in a default installation.
There are 2 core types of gateway modules:

1. Third Party Gateways – Where a customer leaves the site to pay and returns when the payment process completes.
2. Merchant Gateways – Where a customer enters credit card details in WHMCS.
The payment processes in the background.
Can also include 3D Secure where the user leaves your site.

Before starting development of the module for WHMCS, decide which type of gateway module to create.
With that, module creation is ready to begin.
