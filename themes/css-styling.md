If you want to make changes to any of the CSS that is applied by default, we recommend making those customisations inside of the /css/custom.css file.

This file is included after styles.css allowing you to override any of the CSS defined within it and will not be affected by future updates to the WHMCS software.

{{% notice tip %}}
We strongly recommend adding your custom CSS rules to the **custom.css** file and not editing /css/styles.css directly as it will make updating easier.
